# Get-MailboxComparison.ps1
In an Exchange Online to Exchange Online migration (for instance, a Tenant-2-Tenant migration for a purchasing or the separation of a company branch), this PowerShell script monitor the data transfer.
More precisely, this script makes the comparison between a mailbox on the source tenant (e.g., john.smith@contoso.com) and its equivalent on the target tenant (e.g., john.smith@fabrikam.com), to verify if everything (in terms of items and data size) has been correctly transferred.
Please read the synopsis of the script for more details.
